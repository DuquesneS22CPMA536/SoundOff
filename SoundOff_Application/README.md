6. The first is the file named “SoundOff.exe”
   1. Note this file is 70.5 MB and may resist being opened/downloaded due to the nature of being downloaded from the internet – because of this, we    recommend using the GitHub desktop application if possible
   2. Instructions on how to circumnavigate the resistance of files being opened can be found here:https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/this-file-is-potentially-unsafe-to-open-need/b4038008-de01-44cc-8759-38970488b47b
