To find and open the executable file: 

Using the Git hub desktop 
1.	Make sure you are in the “dev” branch
2.	On your computer where your Git-Hub files are located find the SoundOff folder
3.	Then go into the “SoundOff_Application” folder
4.	Double click the “Soundoff.exe” file and it will open for you to use the software

Using the Git hub browser 
1. In the Class Git Hub repository, navigate to the “Code” tab 
2. Make sure you are in the “dev” branch
3. Find and open the folder named SoundOff_executable 
4. You will need to click on and download 2 files from this folder and ensure they are placed in the same folder
5. The first is the file named “SoundOff.exe”
   1. Note this file is rather large and may resist being opened due to the nature of being downloaded from the internet – because of this, we recommend using the GitHub desktop application if possible
6. The second is named “standards.db”
7. Once both files are downloaded and within the same folder, you can double click the “SoundOff.exe” file and it will open for you to use the software.
